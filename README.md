Deliverables

A Heroku Link. Your app must be up and working on Heroku. Don't forget to deploy early in this process! Waiting until the code is entirely finished is just asking for surprises.
Submit your homework via the class assignments Google Form.

Requirements

The following actions should possible for the following types of users:

Visitors who have not logged in should only see the login page.

Students who have logged in should be able to:
See their grades.

Parents who have logged in should be able to:
See their student's grades.

Any user who has logged in should be able to:
Change his or her password.

These lists are not cumulative. For instance, a student should NOT be able to create teachers.

In terms of code, you must:

Use at least two partials.
Use at least two helpers.
Have at least one controller that implements Rails' flavor of REST (i.e. a resources route).

Normal Mode

Although it's definitely a mixed bag, education is a hot spot in both the entrepreneural community and in legislatures these days. Startups are being funded to create all manner of education software, so we're going to jump on the bandwagon and build something.

Assume that you are responsible for building software to track student grades. Three types of users will access your software: teachers (who will enter all of the information about grades, parents, and students), students (who will view their own grades), and parents (who will view their student's grades).

That's the idea; build your application to meet all of the requirements given above.
